TPS Calculator
By James Snee
=================================================================================================

TPS Calculator will calculate the number of concurrent users to use in a Test Case scenario/
Thread group for JMeter/LoadRunner, using Little's Law. Please note that generally Think Time is for 
the overall scenario and Pacing is per test case step, but we use an overall figure for pacing because
you may want to have different pacings for different steps.
